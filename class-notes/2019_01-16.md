## Class Notes - x-block p5.js

Student led a live-coding session and did the following:

- Created a [glitch](https://glitch.com) account
- Went through a step-by-step account of the code for [this project](https://quiet-timer.glitch.me/):
    - Create Canvas
    - Create Dice
    - Create ellipses in the proper place for the dice value
    - Use of a text draw display on top to help determine where the X and Y axis, to aid the drawing process.
```text('X: ' + Math.round(mouseX) + '     ' + ' Y: ' + Math.round(mouseY), 10, 14);```

This reviews many of the core concepts that were addressed in the [first week's class](https://github.com/lrei-coding/p5js_18-19/blob/master/class-notes/2019_01_09.md), in the [peblio hour of code](https://demo.peblio.co/pebl/AXcwQlcDZ).

Students are expected to make all six versions of the dice for both the top and bottom dice and leave them all commented out, except for the ones they are displaying at the time.

## Dice Project

This is a multi-week project and includes the following milestones:
1) Create a 2D visualization of the dice
2) Add some buttons with values 1-6 that a user can select and it will draw a corresponding die with that value
3) Have an animation that can roll the dice and have them randomly selected.
