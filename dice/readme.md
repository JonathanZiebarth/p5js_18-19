This is a multi-week project and includes the following milestones:

- Create a 2D visualization of the dice. [Assignment can be found here](https://github.com/lrei-coding/p5js_18-19/blob/master/dice/dice-assignment_01.md).
- Add some buttons with values 1-6 that a user can select and it will draw a corresponding die with that value. [Assignment can be found here](https://github.com/lrei-coding/p5js_18-19/blob/master/dice/dice-assignment_02.md).
- Have an animation that can roll the dice and have them randomly selected.
