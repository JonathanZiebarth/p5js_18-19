# Dice Project - p5.js class

This is a multi-week project and includes the following milestones:

- Create a 2D visualization of the dice. [See Assignment here](https://github.com/lrei-coding/p5js_18-19/blob/master/dice/dice-assignment_01.md).
- Add buttons (values 1-6) for a user to select and it draws a corresponding die when selected. [See Assignment here](https://github.com/lrei-coding/p5js_18-19/blob/master/dice/dice-assignment_02.md).
- Have an animation that can roll the dice and have them randomly selected.
